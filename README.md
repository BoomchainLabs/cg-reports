# cg-reports
A repo for <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/">W3C Community and Business Groups</a> to manage and publish <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/reports/">final reports</a>. Reports managed through this repo are mirrored on w3.org.

# Usage
To publish a final report, please bring it as a pull request that provides the report content under a directory with  the following convention:
`<cgshortname>/CG-FINAL-<reportshortname>-<YYYYMMDD>/` where `<cgshortname>` is the shortname of the group, `<reportshortname>` is a name of the group's choosing (particularly useful if the group manages several reports), and `<YYYYMMDD>` is the publication date. If your document is developed using <a href="https://github.com/w3c/respec">ReSpec</a>, please provide the static output rather than the dynamic source file.

Once merged by the W3C Community Lead, that content will then be available under the URL `https://www.w3.org/community/reports/<cgshortname>/CG-FINAL-<reportshortname>-<YYYYMMDD>/`.

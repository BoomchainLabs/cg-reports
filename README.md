# cg-reports
A repo to manage and publish Community Groups and Business Group final reports

# Usage
To publish a final report, please bring it as a pull request that provides the report content under a directory with  the following convention:
`<cgshortname>/CG-FINAL-<reportshortname>-<YYYYMMDD>/` where `<cgshortname>` is the shortname of the group, `<reportshortname>` is a name of the group's choosing (particularly useful if the group manages several reports), and `<YYYYMMDD>` is the publication date.

Once merged by the W3C Community Lead, that content will then be available under the URL `https://www.w3.org/community/reports/<cgshortname>/CG-FINAL-<reportshortname>-<YYYYMMDD>/`.
